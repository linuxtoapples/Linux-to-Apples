Neofetch is a TUI (Terminal User Interface) system information tool written in Bash. Neofetch may be one the most well known terminal applications, and for a good reason, it's highly configurable and looks great. However, it is slow... really slow. By no means is Bash a slow language, it just doesn't do so well with the overly massive 10,000 lines of text Neofetch consists of. Thankfully, they're are many great alternatives that do pretty much the same thing, some even do it better. By far my favorite Neofetch alternative is Fastfetch, an extremely underrated TUI application that looks nearly identical to Neofetch. Fastfetch is written in C, which makes it blazing fast. As soon as you touch 'Enter', it instantly appears on your screen! Just run the command 'fastfetch' with 'time' before it and see for yourself the amazing speed. Sometimes it's so fast that it won't even properly time it. Take note r/unixporn!
